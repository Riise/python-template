# Python Project Template

This is a template for a Python project. It is intended to be used as a starting point for creating a new project.

The project contains the following elements:

- VS Code workspace configuration (incl. recommended extensions).
- VS Code development container configuration.
- Pytest configuration.
- Code formatter, type checker, and linter configuration.
- Python security scanner configuration ([Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) and [Pylint Secure Coding Standard](https://github.com/Takishima/pylint-secure-coding-standard)).

To get started see [Development Environment Setup](./docs/dev-env-setup.md) and [Development Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
